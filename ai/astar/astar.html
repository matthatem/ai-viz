  <h1>A*</h1>

  <p>
    This is a visualization of the A* algorithm on a grid world. Obstacles in the gridworld are represented by black pixels.
    The A* search algorithm tries to a find a shortes path between the starting location and the goal location. The goal
    location is centered vertically at the far right edge and the starting location is highlighted in green. The colors represent
    time (which iteration of search) a particular location was explored by the search. Yellow locations were explored earlier
    and dark red locations were search toward the end of the search. This visualization was implemented using
    <a href='http://processingjs.org'>processing.js</a>.
