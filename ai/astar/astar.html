      This is a visualization of the A* algorithm on a grid world. Obstacles in the gridworld are represented by black pixels.
      The A* search algorithm tries to a find a shortest path between the starting location and the goal location. The goal
      location is centered vertically at the far right edge and the starting location is centered vertically about 50 pixels
      from the far left. The colors represent the order in which locations were explored by the search. Yellow locations
      were explored earlier and dark red locations were explored toward the end of the search. This visualization was implemented
      using
      <a href='http://processingjs.org'>processing.js</a>.
